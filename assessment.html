      <h3>1. What is the Electric Daisy Carnival?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/" target="_blank">Electric Daisy Carnival</a> (EDC) is a globally renowned dance music festival and the largest brand in Insomniac's scope of events and productions. EDC began in 1997 as a warehouse party in Los Angeles, produced by CEO and Founder, Pasquale Rotella. Since then it has grown into an internationally acclaimed live music experience, attracting nearly one million fans annually, on four different continents around the world. Electric Daisy carnival was created by Pasquale Rotella. He is the founder of Insomniac which hosts multiple music festivals across the World. Electric Daisy Carnival started in LA, and has since moved to Vegas. But now EDC is in multiple countries across the world and is always growing.</p>

      <p class="indented">I myself have been to EDC a couple of times. This year would have made 5 years and I am really sad that I did not get to go to EDC this year. It would have been the 25th EDC to celebrate in the history of insomniac. I was suppose to go with all my friends. Hopefully it comes back next year.</p>

      <p>EDC is an unique multi-day festival pushing the boundaries of imagination, and setting standards in the live entertainment industry. By incorporating carnival themes and attractions, cutting-edge stage production, world-class talent, and innovative art and technology, EDC is more than an electronic music festival - it is an unparalleled multi-sensory experience unlike any other. The brand has created a passionate community of accepting fans that have turned EDC into a way of life. The foundation upon which the phenomenon was built is one of unity, love, self expression, and respect for one another. <a href="https://www.insomniac.com/who-we-are/we-are-insomniac/" target="_blank"> All about the origin of EDC.</a> </p>
